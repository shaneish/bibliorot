# the 17th shard, adonalsium, and the rosharan system
### the big picture
my current headcannon for how all of the big pieces get put together.  will start with a list and provide a section below with proof/argumentation for each position.  lower positions are dependent on higher positions.

### the pieces
1) there was an original pre-shattering shard -- the 17th shard
2) adonalsium was the "awakened" god metal of the 17th shard
3) the dawnshards were the specific commands given to adonalsium upon awakening
4) \[note: sus] the 17th shard intentionally enabled adonalsium's shattering sussy
5) the rosharan system was set up to enable the adonalsium's return after the powers have had time to mature
6) \[note: sus] braize -- that weird planet known for attracting latent investiture -- is where the metal of adonalsium is reforming (ie atium's pits of hathsin, but for adonalsium)
7) the dawnsingers were placed on roshar to re-awaken adonalsium (to sing the commands/intent needed for awakening)
8) the 17th shard's pool is on roshar and is what ba-ado-mishram drank from -- not odium's pool -- and the amians protect this pool
9) nohadon is some representative of the 17th shard, either vessel or avatar
10) virtuosity's shattering of herself was an act of epic performance meant to artistically portray the shattering of adonalsium -- including the need for the power to mature and recontextualize itself in relation to the other powers
11) frost wants adonalsium to return, hoid wants to prevent it

### the 17th shard
#### 1. there was an original pre-shattering shard

- [Brandon suggested the fansite The 17th Shard their current name.](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/77/#e6605) -- this was done so they could have a name that "would mean something."  It [was a nod to something else in the universe](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/460/#e14616).
  * When you combine this with Frost's organization The Seventeenth Shard, it starts to seem pretty likely that there is/was a separate 17th Shard (and no, not Harmony or Retribution, as Frost's organization was named way before Harmony was ever even thought of).
  * This also does not refer to the possibility of [someone (like Hoid) having become a 17th Shard after the shattering](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/374/#e12132)
- [There is belief in a God who is not one of the shards](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/100/#e3436) - does this refer to the God Beyond or an original Shard? Or possibly both?  I'm not quite sure whether Brandon wants to intentionally conflate the 17th Shard with the God Beyond or not -- I can see either happening in the future, but if they *are* to be conflated than I fear we may never have the full suite of answers here.
  * Hoid seems to conflate the God Beyond and the 17th Shard in a minor fashion through his belief that Adonalsium's shattering may make it possible to bring his old friend/mentor back from the Beyond.
#### 2. adonalsium was the "awakened" god metal
- The name Adonals*ium* seems to be a big, slap-in-the-face hint that Adonalsium is/was a god metal of some type -- specifically, the god metal of a Shard whose name is "Adonai" (the Hebrew word for "Lord" btw).  My best guess is that Adonalsium is/was the god metal of the 17th Shard.
- [Brandon will not state whether Adonalsium is a god metal](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/361/#e11412) and has explicitly stated he has been deliberately cagey to avoid people [thinking of Adonalsium as a "he" or "not a he".](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/509/#e16012)
- We have plenty of examples of sapient/Awakened metals in the Cosmere, such as the Honorblades and Nightblood -- Nightblood being the best example.  We also see a clear story being told with Nightblood where it has trouble truly understanding the commands it was Awakened with ("Destroy Evil") and it on a path towards growing and truly contextualizing what that means.
  * This is almost *exactly* what Nohadon told Dalinar about the powers after Dalinar ascended to Honor -- that the powers needed time to mature and truly understand how to act inline with their intent.
  * Many actors who were at the shattering -- Hoid, Honor, Frost, etc -- echoed feelings that the shattering was "for Adonalsium's own good" -- which highlights the fact that those 16 intents may not have been playing very nicely with each other inside Adonalsium to begin with (or were not playing very nicely with their four associated primal commands, the Dawnshards).
#### 3. the dawnshard were the specific commands given to adonalsium upon awakening

- How can the commands used to Awaken Adonalsium be used to destroy itself?  I think that answer is shown from the trouble the current 16 Shards have in combining with one another and maintaining stability in the presence of one another's intent.  The Intents and Commands of Adonalsium are not internally consistent and it is this inconsistency that allowed it to be shattered by it's own Commands.
  + This is jumping ahead a bit, but look at the story of the Iriali and how Virtuosity shattered herself to allow her power to mature and understand how it should contextualize itself in relation to the other intents.  I believe this is meant to mirror the shattering of Adonalsium itself -- and that is consistent with using it's own Commands to shatter itself.
#### 4. the 17th shard intentionally enabled adonalsium's shattering

---
### the rosharan system
working notes:
  + how do [the dawncities](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dawncity) play into this?  they are definitely connected to the dawnshards and dawnsingers according to [this wob](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/444/#e14378).

#### 5. the rosharan system will enable adonalsium's return

- [The Rosharan system was created for a specific purpose](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/390/#e12702)
- [The Singers were created to be an essential part of the Rosharan system](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/31/#e1723)
- [Dawnshards originated in Roshar?](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/358/#e10752)
#### 6. adonalsium is growing on braize

- [hoid has visited braize](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/221/#e6196)
- [canticle is also similar to braize as an investiture vacuum](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/522/#e16261) -- potentially indicates a hole in this theory.  could these investiture hoovers be associated with dawnshards instead?
  * could these investiture vacuums exist in multiple systems to suck up latent investiture and funnel it somewhere else?
#### 7. the dawnsingers were placed on roshard to re-awaken adonalsium
- [The rhythms the Singers hear pervade the Cosmere but have a specific way of mainfesting on Roshar](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/120/#e7414)
#### 8. the 17th shard's pool is on roshar
- ...
- the pool is currently deep under the shattered plains but was originally on the moon that crashed into roshar.  the moon shattered the plains when the 16 shattered the 1.
- the Dysian Amians came to Roshar with the moon.  They are the eyes that Honor and Odium saw secretly watching them under the Shattered Plains -- hiding behind something "greater than aluminum."
- The old story of Queen Tsa where the moon cames to Roshar and births a blue child is a mythologizing of this event.  The blue skin comes from the Siah Amians, who I suspect are originally from the moon of Nomon.
- [The Rosharan moons may have their own Spren](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/375/#e11918)
#### 9. nohadon is some representative of the 17th shard

### misc
#### 10. virtuosity's greatest act

#### 11. hoid's scheme
- ...
- [Hoid would not call himself a good person](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/31/#e1704)
- [You should be suspicious of Hoid's intentions](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/31/#e1727)
- [Awakened metals may be able to bypass traditional mechanisms related to the Beyond](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/127/#e5074)
- [Hoid is afraid on the Beyond](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/467/#e14725)
- [Reader of the old Dragonsteel: Liars of Partinel unreleased story on Hoid's background says "I just never felt that Hoid was on Adonalsium's side."](https://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=7302.0)
### open questions
1) what is ashyn's place in the rosharan system?  how does it enable adonalsium's reformation?
2) why does hoid want to prevent adonalsium's reformation?  what is his vendetta against adonalsium?
3) what exactly was the Dawn?  Was it simply the single command (including the 4 dawnshard sub-commands) and intent used to awake adonalsium?
4) Was Ba-Ado-Mishram known as Ba-**ADO**-Mishram prior to drinking from the pool?  If not, when did she gain the "Ado" infix and who gave it to her?  If so, what was Mishram's pre-shattering connection to Adonalsium?
5) Does the term "Amians" mean/refer to "moon dwellers?"
6) Does Hoid believe that the God Beyond is the 17th Shard?  Is the 17th Shard a [Shard who can reach the Beyond?] Or are there some of the 16?
7)
