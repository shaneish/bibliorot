I love this theory.  That quote you found from Cultivation in WaT is both impressive and what really sold me on the possible credibility of your theory.  Now that I consider the relationship between aethers and Ado's creations, it actually seems to me as though both Fain and Singers may have been attempts by Ado to fight back against *aether* expansion -- which could explain why both of Ado's non-human life forms were created with *inherent ecologies/symbiotic relationships spanning realms* that gave them access to the investiture needed to defend against aether expansion/parasitism.  This would have *massive* implications for both the coming Cosmere-wide war and the Ghostbloods, who currently have access to both Shardic and aether powers.

This sounds kinda crazy, but here me out:

## the aethers
We know that aethers are *separate* from Adonalsium's creations -- that Adonalsium was not their god (or, at least, we know that's how they're portrayed by others in canon currently).  It is believed that the aethers *predate* Adonalsium[^(\[1\])](#aether-predation) and [Brandon has hinted that the aethers are equals of Adonalsium](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/509-youtube-spoiler-stream-5/#e15989).  I sorta envision them as the "pagans" or "heathens" of Adonalsium's slice of the Cosmere -- where Ado represents the single deity of the Cosmere life we know (similar to our own Adonai/God in Judaeo-Christian tradition).  I say this because if your theory is true, it adds an *entirely new* perspective on why the dragon Xisis has a lab in the bottom of the ocean to study the aether spores on -- more than simple intellectual curiousity, he could be studying them for knowledge that could help the fainlife (or at least the dragons) defend themselves against an aether and/or human expansion.

Do the Fain feel the aether are a potential competitor for their power?  It would make sense, we see that the aether are capable of forming parasitic relationships with non-Fain so I'd expect either of two things:
1) aether are also parasitic towards the Fain themselves (seems unlikely as Xisis is able to heal aether spore infections)
2) the symbiotic relationship between aether and Adonalsium's non-Fain creates an "organism" capable of resisting the Fain power (and/or expansion)

Given what we know so far, I think 2nd option above may be the most likely situation, but to get there we need to explore the underlying nature of Ado's non-human creations.

## the ecologies of ado's non-human creations
Both Singers and Sho Del are both non-human life forms which fill the same ecological niche as humans, unable to wield "magic" on their own.  However, unlike humans, both Singers and Sho Del were created with *their own ecologies* that gave them the ability to wield powerful enough magic within the confines of a symbiotic relationship (and physical location for the Singers).  To defend against aether parasitism, Ado knew his creations needed power possible for life forms purely of the physical realm -- but Ado was also wise enough to realize that power needed to be balanced (hence the need for two conscious entities working in cooperation).  Maybe Ado was even inspired in this choice *by* the aethers.

For the Sho Del on Yolen, Ado created dragons to be their "magic counterpart" (AKA investiture plug).  Dragons were created to be the deities of the Sho Del, cognitive realm beings who can directly draw power from the spiritual realm -- and the Sho Del have a *direct* connection[^(\[2\])](#sho-del-dragon-connection) to these deities via prayer (and presumably other mechanisms).  We don't know much about the Sho Del yet (I'm only a few chapters into Emberdark so hopefully I'll know more soon), but if I had to guess I'd say Dragons prolly have some dependency on the Sho Del as well.  What that dependency is I'm not sure, but it seems probable to me that Ado built some mechanism into dragons to prevent completely unrestricted access to investiture.  Maybe the prayers dragons receive from the Sho Del are needed for their continued access to the spiritual realms?

On Roshar, Ado created both Singers and Spren together in an symbiotic relationship where Singers *need* a bond to a Spren to live (they don't actually "need" a bond, but we see how nearly lifeless the Parshmen are without one) -- and that bond is what grants them access to "forms of power" beyond what a purely physical being is capable of.

In both cases, Ado's non-human creations were made in pairs which allowed them greater "power" -- but bound that power so that it couldn't be unilaterally, balanced by cooperation and consent between different life forms.  The interesting difference here is that on Roshar these life forms lack the direct spiritual realm connection that dragons do.  I will get into this below, but suffice to say that it now makes more sense to me that the Highstorm on Roshar allowed notably easier access to investiture than Ado's other planets had.

## a timeline of ado's creations
It seems to me that Adonalsium had a soft spot for creating human-ish life; Singers and Sho Del are human-esque and fill a similar ecological niche as humans and dragons also have a human form. Given that Fainlife is viewed as *expanding into non-Fain territory*, the following **timeline of creation** seems plausible:
1) humans were the first living creation of Adonalsium (at least that we have met so far)
2) as humans *can be* infected by aether spores, it also seems plausible that Fainlife was created by Adonalsium to be powerful enough *to resist aether parasitism* -- a way to protect his creation from encroachment of powers outside his control
3) Ado's introduction of Fainlife didn't go quite as planned, with Ado creating *another* ecological challenge for humans -- the direct access to the spiritual realm that dragons were given, human life was unable resist their expansion
4) Ado then created the Singers and Spren on Roshar to be a new life form resilient to aether parasitism *but limited in their ability to expand and conquer his other forms of creation*

The last part there is what's key.  Singers and Spren *can* wield investiture in a way that would allow them to defend themselves from aethers, but neither can directly pull investiture directly from the spiritual realm.  Rather, Spren act almost like investiture antennae that can pull from *external* sources of investiture -- but the intended source of investiture, the Highstorm, was bound to the planet of Roshar.  This meant that Singers and Spren would be able to resist aether expansion onto their planet, but would be unable to expand into the other worlds and ecologies of the Cosmere (theoretically, at least -- we've already seen some of the loopholes in this plan).  In fact, the Singers and Spren were not just limited to the *planet* of Roshar, but specifically to the continent the Stormlight series plays out on which was in the path of the Highstorm.

There could potentially be other landmasses on the Rosharan planet with other forms of life (similar to the humans and Fain both inhabiting different regions of Yolen) -- and, within the system setup by Ado, the Singers would be unable to expand to them *with their powers* due to the bounds of the Highstorm.  Nothing stopping them from visiting these other lands, they would just be in the form of Parshmen without forms of power.  This seems like fairly solid circumstantial evidence of Ado's intent here -- to fix the mistakes of his fainlife creations.

## the future war
What's interesting to me now that I consider this possibility is that it adds an entirely new dimension to the coming Cosmere-wide war.  I *knew* Brandon was doing something sneaky with aethers so far, I just didn't know what -- but I knew it had to be meaningful since he gave us an entire book about aether spores (Tress).  Additionally, I knew *something* special was happening in TLM with TwinSoul (cool name btw) *showing us* the potential power that aether parasitism can bring to humans when the humans and aether are working symbiotically.

This new perspective provided to me by the OP really hammers down what is to come.  This may not just be a war between Shards, but a much greater war between multiple powers which rival the unshattered power of Adonalsium himself -- and a war that is about to get *really* messy, given Kelsier and the Ghostbloods have already begun to harness the powers of both Adonalsium (via Shards) *and* the aethers (whose powers potentially rival or exceed that of Adonalsium by himself)!
