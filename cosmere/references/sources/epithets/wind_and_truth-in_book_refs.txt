I should have known I was being watched. All my life, the signs were there.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 1

I first knew the Wind as a child, during days before I knew dreams. What need has a child of dreams or aspirations? They live, and love, the life that is.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 3

The Wind told me, before she vanished, that it was the change in Odium’s vessel that restored her voice. I wonder. Perhaps it is the new storm, making people begin to reconsider that the wind is not their enemy.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 3

Or to worship the Storm instead.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 4

As a historian, I find such nuances relevant. As a philosopher, I find them enticing.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 4

They are my witnesses.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 5

However, the Wind did not think like a person does. This should not surprise anyone who has familiarity with a spren, though such things are less common now than they once were.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 5

But she somehow knew it anyway.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 5

All agree the first key moment came when Kaladin Stormblessed listened. Though not an Edgedancer, he did a fine impression of their oaths.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 8

The second moment had happened already, when Szeth himself decided to take upon him this quest. The one that would shape all of our futures.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 8

For while the contest of champions was to happen in the East, a different contest was to happen in Shinovar. And one that the Wind swore was equally vital. Perhaps more so.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 8

I was not with them. I did not know of their quest.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 10

Yet I will do my best to recount their story, and that of the Wind. For they were her champions.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 11

As I approached the first crossroads, I met a family seeking a new life.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

This family did not speak my language, but we could both write glyphs, which proved facilitative in our conversation. As I shared their kindly cookfire, I learned some of their story.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

They had left behind family and hereditary home, something many would find unconscionable.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

What I learned from their glyphs scribbled in dust trembled my soul: it was because of me, and the stories they’d heard of my teachings, that they had left.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

They’d gone to seek a land some told them was mythical.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

A land where the king was a holy man, and was concerned with the plight of the farmer beyond the appropriation of taxes.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

I let them pass with two lies.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

First, I dared not tell them this dusty traveler with whom they shared a meal was in fact that very king they had heard of. The second was that I did not explain that very king had abdicated his throne and walked away from his kingdom.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

After we parted with affection the next day, I watched their cart roll into the distance, pulled by the father with two children riding in the rear, the mother striding with a pack on her back. Dust blew with them, for dust goes where it wishes, ignoring all borders.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

Would that men could always do the same—if I could enshrine one law in all further legal codes, it would be this. Let people leave if they wish.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

The Almighty has given us the limbs to move and the minds to decide. Let no monarch take away what was divinely granted. The Heralds also taught that all should have the sacred right of freedom of movement, to escape a bad situation. Or simply to seek a brighter dawn.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

I continued on my way, contemplating dust and the nature of desertion. For I, as king, had walked away from my duties, and it was different for me. Had I not renounced a throne the Almighty had granted, and in so doing, undermined my very own words? Was I abandoning that which was divinely given me?
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

I do not have answers, and there will always be some who denounce me for this decision I made. But let me teach a truth here that is often misunderstood: sometimes, it is not weakness, but strength, to stand up and walk away.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

Those who offer blanket condemnation are fools, for each situation deserves its own consideration, and rarely can you simply apply a saying—even one of mine—to a situation without serious weighing of the context.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

As I fear not the child with a weapon he cannot lift, I will never fear the mind of a man who does not think.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

So think, my dear reader. As a soldier retreats from a battle he cannot win. As a woman rejects a home that shows her only violence. As a family finds hope in walking away from dying fields during a season of too much rain.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

As a king leaves a people with the gift of his absence, so that they may grow and solve their own problems, without his hand to always guide them.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

May you have the courage someday to walk away. And the wisdom to recognize that day when it arrives.
—From The Way of Kings, fourth parable

Now, it stands to the accountability of reason that orders of Radiants, greatly interposed from common nature by their various oaths, should have had some controversions one to another.
—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 1

Of different note, as Vava will attest in great disbursement, is that within orders strife is unexpected, yet still vulgar, of a shape and manifold variety, that is often overlooked, still worthy of consideration.
—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 1

While Willshapers embraced this very sense of contrarity, an attitude that will come as no great surprise to any conversant with their predilections, and indeed might be found unexpected in its absence, the presence of such strife among Skybreakers is a source of no small stupefaction to many.
—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 1

Indeed, the presence of a Herald among them should have, to all reasonable understandings, and to the abridgment of expectation, led to stability of doctrine among this most specific of orders.
—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 1

Irid adjudges this reasoning spurious, given the Skybreaker air of exactitude, that dissention is inevitable, as they turn finer points of argument against one another.
—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 2

I challenge that itself to be perfidious; having studied much of their natures, and having made a specific attempt to represent their minds accurately, I find myself confident in my delineation; it is of particular passion and perfection in me; as perhaps I would have known them myself, given opportunity.
—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 2

Indeed, I find Skybreaker disagreements remarkable; I have preference for each account, seeing as the arguments of the great arguers are of the most engaging variety, as to leave a woman disposed to both one side or the other, at a variety of times, vacillating back and forth, first the first, then second the second, to accede victory to whichever last has spoken.
—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 2

It is to this end that I have identified and made particular note of three distinct factions of Skybreakers, even during Nale’Elin’s days of direct leadership, and this is to be found in my third coda.
—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 2

I wish not to engage to the reader their faults, rather to make it clear that an order so determined to care for the unwanted, the unguarded, and the disenfranchised would obviously have passionate disagreement in how to best attend to the needs of the lowly and disregarded.
—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 2

Indeed, some insist that among Radiants, some Skybreakers did step forth into the Recreance, and their actions are covered; to this end, I have engaged the commentary of Didal; it strikes as mendacious that any Skybreaker would turn upon their oaths, and I find their malignment to be uniformly abhorrent. A schism arose among them, as all evidence presents, but not of this nature. The Skybreakers, who have always quietly cared for those the law forgets, do still exist, as previously accounted; they merely exist in multiple forms.
—From Words of Radiance, chapter 40, page 3

You now know of my sins in full. You now also know of my revelations, if they may be called that, in full. Each of my visions is here. Each experience of my past that shaped me.
—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin

Both have as much detail as I can remember. My life. My reign. My sorrow. My glory.
—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin

It is not my goal to begin a new religion, or to inspire a division in Vorinism. However, I insist that when I was at my darkest moments, there was something there with me, and it was not the being we called the Almighty. He is dead. And even if he were not, I would find his actions increasingly suspect.
—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin

I realize this is, in a way, ridiculous. I, who proclaim a god to be dead, am also the one who rejects the idea that no God exists. And yet my very being—soul, mind, body—rebels at the idea that nothing out there cares. It must.
—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin

Jasnah says that the existence of an all-powerful and all-loving God must be questioned by the simple evidence of injustices done in life to the innocent, such as the child who dies from disease.
—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin

Jasnah’s argument is probably the greatest a person could make against what I teach, and so it must be addressed. I am not certain I have the philosophy, the words, or the experience to do so with the respect it deserves.
—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin

But I will say that for me, the existence of something that cares—and can, after death, make up for injustices in life—is not the question. But the answer.
—From the epilogue to Oathbringer, by Dalinar Kholin. Excerpt used at his tribunal, in absentia—for the appeal filed on his behalf by supporters after his excommunication from the Vorin church—as evidence of continued heresy.

I sense I’ve done a poor job of explaining the exact nature of antiLight. This might be in part because even I, its discoverer, do not yet understand all the nuances of what I’ve done, though I do worry the ramifications of it will be felt for ages.
—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin

Some might assume that Light and anti-Light are opposites, as can be found in philosophy, though not truly in actual physical science. Hot banishes and destroys cold. Light banishes and destroys dark. Likewise, one might say that Light and anti-Light are opposites in that they are mutually destructive.
—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin

… In mathematics, we have negative numbers—an impossible reality, yet an extremely useful model, as explained by the woman who developed them. Negative one balances with one to create zero, both evening out at nothing.
—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin

This is closer to the interactions of Light and anti-Light, yet I do not fully accept it as the proper parallel either.
—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin

Instead, I find the closest model to be that of destructive interference in sound. A destructive waveform is not itself an opposite, but indeed the exact same waveform played opposite the primary one.
—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin

The destructive version of a melody is not its opposite, then, but instead the exact same song played back at precisely the right time to negate the melody. If you were to hear the two in isolation, you would not be able to tell the difference.
—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin

Anti-Light is not inherently the opposite of standard Light, nor is it negative, or imaginary, or a philosophical opposite. It is a different phase of the same entity. I see it more like the same melody, played at a different time.
—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin

The same song. Played at different times.
—From Rhythm of War, first coda, Navani Kholin

The Wind was not there for the contest of champions, the final confrontation between Odium and the mortals who would oppose him. She felt ostracized from that world, where it was Storms—and not Wind—who drew attention.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 18

As the lands began to think of them, and remember them, they needed less the bond of a single person to give them purchase in the Physical Realm. For the thoughts of an entire people bolstered them.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 46

I record here the notes of the song. The Wind knows it very well. I cannot hear her voice, but sometimes I hear the flute.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 117

Curiously, the closest I came to the Knight of Wind and the Knight of Truth during their quest happened during the last hours before Stormfall. When they visited my parents’ house, while I was asleep, and purchased their wagon.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 27

I will leave one to ponder upon the incredible irony of the Herald of Bonds deciding he needed to teach Szeth, of all people, how to be humble. As if years of slavery weren’t a capable instructor.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 83

I often reflect upon how the world changed that day. And how I spent it, completely unaware, working in the family orchard. Picking fruit while the End of All Things itself came upon us.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 92

I find stories of the Knight of Wind to be most intriguing. They call him Stormblessed, but best I can tell, the storm alternately tried to kill him and proclaim him its son. I wonder what it knew that we do not.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 34

Much of what I know of the Knight of Wind, I get from Jasnah Kholin. Now head of our order, and a woman who has shown much patience for a simple Shin bookworm who thinks herself worthy of the task of writing this account.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 22

To this day, I wish I had all the answers. Would that someday, a historian could make a record with all possible information at her fingertips. For example, what was it Ishu did to prepare himself for what he knew the Knights would attempt? It still baffles explanation, as do many Bondsmith arts.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 201

I keep returning to this idea. As I feel it should be explored further.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 201

For the events surrounding the contest at Urithiru, I must refer you to another volume of this multi-author work. One that has, unfortunately, not yet been written.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 238

There were not two heroes that day, but many.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 237

“One is not enough. The change must come from many.”
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 237

I can’t speak to that. But I can speak to the testimony of one man’s experience. That of what it felt like to be in the very depths of despair, and then to have someone stand up and try their best to shield you from it.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 237

The Wind itself accepted his Words.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 249

Most interesting are those in between. Those who feel neither emotion. Those who can use the sword, but walk a fine line upon its edge.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 266

The land trembled at what Dalinar Kholin did.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 181

On that day, the Knight of Truth did not save us from the evil that had been prophesied. But from the evil brought by the prophesier.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 281

And now we reach the part of the narrative where I can but speculate, as my witnesses were both unconscious.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 271

I can only guess what happened, therefore, to the Knight of Wind. That he is dead is demonstrable. That he succeeded, at least in part, is also demonstrable.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 289

Or perhaps, as champion of the Wind, Kaladin was able to do something in the end right before he died, which turned Retribution’s ire from the spren.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, page 290

The day that everything changed.
—From Knights of Wind and Truth, an account of the cleansing of Shinovar by Masha-daughter-Shaliv, six years following Stormfall, page 292
