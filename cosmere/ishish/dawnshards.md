# dawnshard stuff

### 0. misc
- [one dawnshard is different from the rest](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/226/#e4824)
- [the dawnshard self protect -- which includes the existence and/or location of the dawnshards and larkins](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/509/#e15937)
- [was a dawnshard involved in nightblood's creation?](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/509/#e16006)
  + this one is super interesting, does this imply there is a Dawnshard for Destroy?  And could Nightblood's inability to know what Evil is and it's growing self-awareness of that be analogous to what happened to Adonalsium?
- [does the transfer of dawnshards work similarly to the transfer of breath?](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/444/#e14329)
  + as in, does a dawnshard have to be willing given up and received between the two parties?
  + so, in a way, is breath an analog to dawnshards?  this kinda makes sense, given awakening with breath requires a Command and Intent.
  + [actually, this is looking more like the case](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/448/#e14411)
- [does investiture derive from dawnshards?](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/444/#e14324)
- [normal rules of investiture don't apply to dawnshards](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/509/#e15933)
  + this aligns with the previous wob, actually.
- [is jaddeth a dawnshard](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/472/#e14884)
  + a little confused on what led to this question or what evidence currently exists, but brandon's reaction seems to suggest it's on to something.
- [possible for four shards that share a common intent in line with one of the primal commands (dawnshards) to recombine into a megashard without issues taking action like sazed](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/517/#e16197)
- [the magic system of the dawnshards predate the magic of the shards](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/176/#e8498)
  + this is particularly interesting, as the shards and their powers descend directly from the power of adonalsium -- so the dawnshards being beyond the magic of adonalsium suggests that adonalsium wasn't the original god.  this is good circumstantial evidence that adonalsium is an awakened god metal and not a deity.
- [are there four investiture attracting planets in the cosmere?  one for each dawnshart?]
- [the grand apparatus and "doing adonalsium's work"](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/522/#e16290)

### 1. zellion has a dawnshard (no, not that dawnshard)
- [does sigzil now hold a different dawnshard?](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/494/#e15578)
  + did the historical zellion leave the people of canticle with a dawnshard after their migration?  was the purpose of the migration to move them to a system where the dawnshard could be kept safe?
  + did they transfer this dawnshard to sigzil along with the title of "zellion"?
  + "rebekke" is a weird name for a canticle-ese -- especially compared to the other names which seem more like descriptions.
    + could this be a reference to the biblical rebecca?
    + in the bible, rebecca acted as an agent of god to see that god's blessing was transfered to jacob instead of his older brother esau.  is TSM analogous to this, with the "blessing" being a different dawnshard?
- [canticle also attracts latent investiture like braize](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/522/#e16261)
  + could these planets be associated with dawnshards instead of adonalsium itself?

### 2. ghostbloods and dawnshards
- [hoid was shocked he was able to punch kelsier with his torment](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/444/#e14359)
  + this plays into the "dawnshards will protect themselves" mechanic -- which presumably applies to hoid's dawnshard as well.  was hoid able to punch kelsier because the dawnshard believes kelsier is a threat to it?
- do the ghostbloods have a dawnshard that they took from kelek?  what we know:
  1) taln tried to kill cultivation with a "weapon" -- and few weapons other than dawnshards can threaten a shard.  nightblood is the only other one we know of and taln's weapon was not nightblood (nightblood was created after the heralds became heralds)
  2) at the end of WaT, taln asked kelek if he was still upset he lost "the weapon" he gave him:
    a)
