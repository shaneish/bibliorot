# unmade sapience
a curious distinction can be made between the various unmade: those who are sapient, and those who aren't.

we know (or are led to believe) that the unmade were spren corrupted (or "unmade") by odium and we have the following list of unmade:
*sapient*:
- Ba-Ado-Mishram
- Chemoarish
- Dai-Gonarthis
- Yelig-nar
- Moelach
- Sja-anat
- Re-Shephir
*not sapient*:
- Ashertmarn
- Moelach
- Nergaoul

there are 9 true (sapient) spren which can bond with humans and there are 9 unmade -- so my first intuition is that each unmade is a corruption of one of the true spren.  however, given that 3 of the unmade are considered "mindless," this doesn't match up quite as well as i'd have thought; why would 3 of them lose their sentience?

consider, however, that these measures of "mindlessness" are being taken by humans in the *physical realm* -- a realm in which sapient spren have traditionally (until the end of WaT when the unoathed were created) needed to *bond* to a human to exist in the physical realm enough to have sapience.  an interesting note is that the 3 mindless unmade all share a common interaction pattern -- they manipulate and influence the minds of men.  could it actually be that the 6 sapient unmade have a formed nahel bond with some person or singer in the physical realm which gives their physical realm representation sapience?  and the 3 mindless unmade are able to influence minds due to the lack of a bond?

if so, who are the sapient unmade bound to??
