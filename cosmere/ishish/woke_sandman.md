>  Part "it's woke now" bullshit. 

This is what really gets me, I swear the vast majority of the "woke" complaints are just coming from people pretending to be fans.  Anyone who has read enough of the Cosmere knows Brandon has been infected by the "woke mind virus" since the very beginning -- literal decades of Brandon hugging us to death with his "wokeness."

Even going back to the original Mistborn trilogy, we had conversations like this one between OrSeur<!/TenSoon!> and Vin in WoA:
> "Yes, I know," Vin said, using a pair of sapphire barrettes to pin the sides of her hair back a bit from her face. "But . . . well, I'd forgotten how much fun these things could be to wear."
>
> "I fail to see why that would be, Mistress."
>
> "That's because you're a man."
>
> "Actually, I'm a kandra."
>
> "But you're a boy kandra."
>
> "How do you know that?" OreSeur asked. "Gender is not easy to tell in my people, since our forms are fluid."
>
> Vin looked at him, raising an eyebrow. "I can tell."

Bro has been quietly telling us gender is independent of the particular biological meat puppet we're born in since 2007 and you didn't figure out he was woke until the Year of our Lord 2025!?  And let me tell you, this was *not* a common perception back in 2007 -- forget trans acceptance,  back in 2007 gay marriage was illegal and we still had Democrat politicians telling us it was Satanic.  I was in high school in the mid-2000s and had *a lot* of LGB friends back then and even we didn't have a conception of gender independent of sex back then -- and my best friend at the time would go on to transition a few years later in 2013 (go figure the beefy lesbian we used to joke had the biggest dick was really a man after all).

Like, not only was it not a well know concept, but being trans was seen as disdainful and mocked by most adult Americans -- not just conservatives... and here we have faithful LDS author Brando Sando, wayyyy back then, planting the seeds of progress and acceptance in our young, impressionable minds.

Even [his 2008 blog post on gay representation in media](https://web.archive.org/web/20071030005344/http://www.brandonsanderson.com/article.php?id=51), while not progressive by today's standards, was pretty damn progressive for public discourse back then.  It's easy to look back on it from 2025 and criticize him for it in retrospect (and people certainly have), but society is drastically different now and back then a practicing member of a deeply conservative religious community standing up for positive depictions of homosexuality in literature while openly admitting he grapples with how to reconcile church doctrine and personal views was not an easy public position to take.

To add some perspective, this was *5 years* before Obama was even willing to publicly take a stand with LGB Americans.  It's almost sad to see people who were still in diapers in 2008 call him a coward for this blog post, because as someone alive back then I can tell you it was anything but.  Adults who were sympathetic towards gay plight back then did not say it publicly; it was very much a quiet sympathy back then.

When I read his essay now, I see the words of a man who had been struggling deeply to reconcile what he *knows* is right with what his faith tells him is right -- you can tell by his words how much time he'd spent trying to fit a square cube into a circular hole.  You could also tell he was just beginning to find his courage to speak up.  When I read his old essay, I can *feel* in it a man trying to hype himself up and forestall the backlash he knew his words would draw:
> All I'm saying is that if you believe in the truth of your message, then you shouldn't care if someone decent, respected, and intelligent is depicted as believing differently from yourself. Decent, respected, and intelligent people can be wrong--and you can still respect them. It's okay.

Those words were ostensibly directed at JK Rowling (ya ya, don't get me started -- like I said 2008 was a much different time), but it's hard to read those sentences and not feel he's also arguing for respect and leniency for his own message as well.

This was pre-WoT, so Sanderson was not the well respected, highly successful, 10+ NYT Best Selling Author he is today.  Sanderson today is too big to ignore and can afford to publicly disagree with his community and church teachings.  The Sanderson who wrote this essay, however, was just a normal person, an author with one or two modestly successful books.  This was a Sanderson who had a lot to lose, yet still couldn't help himself from pushing back -- despite struggling to reconcile the truth in his own heart with the doctrine in his own mind.

It is men and women like 2008 Brandon who move the wheel of progress; people who care enough to grapple with uncomfortable questions, people willing to speak while others remain quiet, people who just can't help but say something despite the risks.  2025 Brandon is still a force for good in the world, but it's not rich & famous authors sharing *controversial* views who move the wheel; it's 2008 Brandon -- your friendly neighbors and quiet coworkers, willing to share their *uncomfortable* truth who really move the wheel.

The Sandman has always been "woke."  He may be more direct with it now, but any who goes back and reads his old books and essays within the social context they were written will find it all over the pages.
