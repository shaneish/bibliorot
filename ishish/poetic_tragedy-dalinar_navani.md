# the poetic tragedy of dalinar & navani
## the beautiful dark symmetry of their spiritual paths
This small doc was inspired by one beautiful yet tragic moment at the end of Wind and Truth, when Dalinar gave up Honor and Navani immediately began the fight against Retribution:

---

*We have to keep Retribution out of Urithiru*, the Sibling said.  *He's going to destroy the spren, but not us here if we can create defenses.* ***It will be your will and mine against his.  I don't know if...Oh, Shards, Navani.  He's coming!***

**"Do it!"** Navani said.

---

Dalinar & Navani were brought together by fate itself.  Gavilar Kholin wielded both Dalinar & Navani as tools to build his Tiny Empireâ„¢ in Kholinar -- Dalinar ran his Army and Navani Ran his Kingdom.  Navani & Dalinar, the Pen and Sword of Kholinar<sup>[1]</sup>.

Dalinar won his fight by losing it -- sacrificing himself and the Shard of Honor to save the Cosmere from Odium's wrath.  Navani's plunge to save Urithiru happened almost immediately after Dalinar's "death" -- and continues beyond the story's end.

*Brightness Navani, one of Roshar's greatest antifabrians, now nothing more than a Spren trapped in a (giant) gemstone -- the antifabrian becomes the fabrial*

#### Notes
+ \[1] They say the Pen is mightier than the Sword, which makes me think Navani will play a much bigger role in the 2nd arc of the Stormlight Archives.
