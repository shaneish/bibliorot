You think Gavinor will die fighting Taravangian's Blackthorn? I think he'll kill him.

Taravangian raised Gavinor to hate and kill Dalinar -- and that's exactly what he'll do. However, the Dalinar he raised Gavinor to hate isn't the Dalinar we saw him become, but the Dalinar he once was -- the Blackthorn. Is it simply coincidence that right after Dalinar Dalinar gave his life to save Gavinor -- the exact opposite of what Gavinor was promised -- Taravangian suddenly finds a living, breathing Blackthorn to conquer the Cosmere for him? Nah, the symmetry and foreshadow here is just too great for anything else to happen than Gavinor ultimately becoming the exact Blackthorn-killing weapon Taravangian created him to be.

Brandon loves symmetry and he loves to tell you exactly what's going to happen -- but he does so within a context that makes you think it will happen a different time, place, or situation than is actually planned. Then, when it finally happens, it's like getting slapped in the face. The misdirection becomes blatantly obvious. Anytime Brandon creates a situation in which a given sentence can be fulfilled word-for-word into two polar opposite ways, your sus radar should start going wild.

Taravangian promised Gavinor the opportunity to kill Dalinar and Brandon will deliver on that promise -- just, in usual Brandon style, not when and how you expect it to be delivered. Taravangian made Gavinor into a weapon designed to kill Dalinar and that's exactly what he'll be -- just not the weapon to kill Dalinar the Uniter during the contest of champions as we're led to believe.

No no no, *Gavinor will be the weapon used to kill Dalinar the Blackthorn during Taravangian's the battle for the Cosmere.*

**And it will be beautiful.**
