  + notes:
    + old, outdated origin story of hoid
    + let hoid¹ be the hoid in liar of partinel
    + let hoid² be the hoid we know from the current post-shattering cosmere
    + hoid¹ from this story is the mentor of midius. presumably midius becomes hoid² -- which also explains why the heralds know hoid² as midius in WaT
    + brandon mentioned that this was never released because it portrayed a certain character (presumably hoid²) in a more negative light than he'd imagine
    + is the person hoid² is obsessed with bringing back from the dead hoid¹?  we know from The Traveler that hoid² has a vendetta against someone (presumably the original shard or the God Beyond) and his mission is to bring someone he cared about back from the beyond
- hoid's cause
