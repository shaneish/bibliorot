# the 17th shard, adonalsium, and the rosharan system
### the big picture
my current headcannon for how all of the big pieces get put together.  will start with a list and provide a section below with proof/argumentation for each position.  lower positions are dependent on higher positions.

### the pieces
1) there was an original pre-shattering shard -- the 17th shard
2) adonalsium was the "awakened" god metal of the 17th shard
3) the dawnshards were the specific commands given to adonalsium upon awakening
4) \[note: sus] the 17th shard intentionally enabled adonalsium's shattering sussy
5) the rosharan system was set up to enable the adonalsium's return after the powers have had time to mature
6) braize -- that weird planet known for attracting latent investiture -- is where the metal of adonalsium is reforming (ie atium's pits of hathsin, but for adonalsium)
7) the dawnsingers were placed on roshar to re-awaken adonalsium (to sing the commands/intent needed for awakening)
8) the 17th shard's pool is on roshar and is what ba-ado-mishram drank from -- not odium's pool -- and the amians protect this pool
9) nohadon is some representative of the 17th shard, either vessel or avatar
10) virtuosity's shattering of herself was an act of epic performance meant to artistically portray the shattering of adonalsium
11) frost wants adonalsium to return, hoid wants to prevent it

### the deets
#### 1. there was an original pre-shattering shard

  - [There is belief in a God who is not one of the shards](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/100/#e3436)
#### 2. adonalsium was the "awakened" god metal of the 17th shard

#### 3. the dawnshard were the specific commands given to adonalsium upon awakening

#### 4. the 17th shard intentionally enabled adonalsium's shattering

#### 5. the rosharan system will enable adonalsium's return

  - [The Rosharan system was created for a specific purpose](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/390/#e12702)
  - [The Singers were created to be an essential part of the Rosharan system](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/31/#e1723)
  - [Dawnshards originated in Roshar?](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/358/#e10752)
#### 6. adonalsium is growing on braize

  - [hoid has visited braize](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/221/#e6196)
#### 7. the dawnsingers were placed on roshard to re-awaken adonalsium
  - [The rhythms the Singers hear pervade the Cosmere but have a specific way of mainfesting on Roshar](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/120/#e7414)
#### 8. the 17th shard's pool is on roshar
  - ...
  - the pool is currently deep under the shattered plains but was originally on the moon that crashed into roshar.  the moon shattered the plains when the 16 shattered the 1.
  - the Dysian Amians came to Roshar with the moon.  They are the eyes that Honor and Odium saw secretly watching them under the Shattered Plains -- hiding behind something "greater than aluminum."
  - The old story of Queen Tsa where the moon cames to Roshar and births a blue child is a mythologizing of this event.  The blue skin comes from the Siah Amians, who I suspect are originally from the moon of Nomon.
  - [The Rosharan moons may have their own Spren](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/375/#e11918)
#### 9. nohadon is some representative of the 17th shard

#### 10. virtuosity's greatest act

#### 11. hoid's scheme
  - ...
  - [Hoid would not call himself a good person](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/31/#e1704)
  - [You should be suspicious of Hoid's intentions](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/31/#e1727)
  - [Awakened metals may be able to bypass traditional mechanisms related to the Beyond](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/127/#e5074)
  - [Hoid is afraid on the Beyond](https://wob.coppermind.net/events/467/#e14725)
  - [Reader of the old Dragonsteel: Liars of Partinel unreleased story on Hoid's background says "I just never felt that Hoid was on Adonalsium's side."](https://twg.17thshard.com/index.php?topic=7302.0)
### open questions
1) what is ashyn's place in the rosharan system?  how does it enable adonalsium's reformation?
2) why does hoid want to prevent adonalsium's reformation?  what is his vendetta against adonalsium?
3) what exactly was the Dawn?  Was it simply the single command (including the 4 dawnshard sub-commands) and intent used to awake adonalsium?
4) Was Ba-Ado-Mishram known as Ba-**ADO**-Mishram prior to drinking from the pool?  If not, when did she gain the "Ado" infix and who gave it to her?  If so, what was Mishram's pre-shattering connection to Adonalsium?
5) Does the term "Amians" mean/refer to "moon dwellers?"
6) Does Hoid believe that the God Beyond is the 17th Shard?  Is the 17th Shard a [Shard who can reach the Beyond?] Or are there some of the 16?
7)
