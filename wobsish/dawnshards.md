### 1. zellion has a dawnshard (no, not that dawnshard)
- [does sigzil now hold a different dawnshard?](https://wob.coppermind.net/adv_search/?query=hoid+intent)
  + did the historical zellion leave the people of canticle with a dawnshard after their migration?  was the purpose of the migration to move them to a system where the dawnshard could be kept safe?
  + did they transfer this dawnshard to sigzil along with the title of "zellion"?
  + "rebekke" is a weird name for a canticle-ese -- especially compared to the other names which seem more like descriptions.
    + could this be a reference to the biblical rebecca?
    + in the bible, rebecca acted as an agent of god to see that god's blessing was transfered to jacob instead of his older brother esau.  is TSM analogous to this, with the "blessing" being a different dawnshard?
