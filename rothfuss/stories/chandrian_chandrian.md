"When the hearthfire turns to blue,
What to do? What to do?
Run outside. Run and hide.

"When his eyes are black as crow?
Where to go? Where to go?
Near and far. Here they are.

"See a man without a face?
Move like ghosts from place to place.
What's their plan? What's their plan?
Chandrian. Chandrian.

"When the hearthfire turns to blue,
What to do? What to do?
Run outside. Run and hide.

When your bright sword turns to rust?
Who to trust? Who to trust?
Stand alone. Standing stone."

See a woman pale as snow?
Silent come and silent go.
What's their plan? What's their plan?
Chandrian. Chandrian.
