# ever-faithful love (arliden, laurian, parents)
While I rummaged around for needle and thread I heard my mother singing:

*"In evening when the sun is setting fast,*
*I'll watch for you from high above*
*The time for your return is long since past*
*But mine is ever-faithful love."*

My father answered:

*"In evening when the light is dying*
*My feet at last are homeward turning*
*The wind is through the willows sighing*
*Please keep the hearthfire burning."*

# greystone by the road, greystone on a hill (to faeriniel or myr tariniel)

*"Like a drawstone even in our sleep*
*Standing stone by old road is the way*
*To lead you ever deeper into Fae.*
*Laystone as you lay in hill or dell*
*Greystone leads to* something something 'ell'." [note: possibly "myr tariniel"]

> then kvothes mom says:

"Besides, the only tradition that keeps troupes by the
greystone is laziness. The poem should run like this:

*"Whatever the season*
*That I'm on the road*
*I look for a reason*
*Loden or laystone*
*To lay down my load."*

# arliden (dad) song about lanre

*"Sit and listen all, for I will sing*
*A story, wrought and forgotten in a time*
*Old and gone. A story of a man.*
*Proud Lanre, strong as the spring*
*Steel of the sword he had at ready hand.*
*Hear how he fought, fell, and rose again,*
*To fall again. Under shadow falling then.*
*Love felled him, love for native land,*
*And love of his wife Lyra, at whose calling*
*Some say he rose, through doors of death*
*To speak her name as his first **reborn breath."***
