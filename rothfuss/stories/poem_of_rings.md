*"On his first hand*

*he wore rings of stone,*

*Iron, amber, wood, and bone.*

*There were---"*

The smith's prentice frowned. "I can't remember the rest. There was
something about fire...."

The innkeeper's expression was unreadable. He looked down at where his
own hands lay spread on the top of the bar, and after a moment he
recited:

*"There were rings unseen on his second hand.*

*One was blood in a flowing band.*

*One of air all whisper thin,*

*And the ring of ice had a flaw within.*

*Full faintly shone the ring of flame,*

*And the final ring was without name."*
