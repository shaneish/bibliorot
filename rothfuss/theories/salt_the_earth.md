# lanre, salt of the earth
## questions/observations
- something strange is going on with salt in this book -- it's almost viewed as tool to ensure finality or that an ended conflict stays ended.
- **WAIT WAIT WAIT**! *does salt prevent draugars from coming back??* are the chandrian killing people because they are turning into draugars?
- so both non-mortal entities in kvothe's world have their own weakness: iron for faen and salt for skinwalkers?
- also, did lanre(/tarsus) make a deal with *someone* (whoever controls the draugarwalkers) to bring lyra back from the dead?  was that "sold his soul" deal?  the "forces best left alone"?
- since lanre referenced burning myr tariniel as "sowing salt" multiple times, does that also mean that lanre considered myr tariniel to be full of draugarwalkers?  does that mean *selitos* is the one with the draugarwalkers??  if so, that...kinda makes sense, as his realm (myr tariniel) burning would then be akin to hel- the backwards saltwater river flowing into southern vintas...when i look at a map of temarant, the only thing i see similar to that is a river flowing deep down beyond the boundaries of the page into the forest itself.  could the fae simply be...south of vintas?  or is that just faerinial?  is the difference between faerinial and fae that faerinial is a "crown" city of the fae realm on the mortal world?  would that apply to myr tarinial as well?  the name "myr tarinial" makes me believe it means "crown across over the myr/automaton"?
- is selitos jax?  is the mansion he built in the mountains myr tariniel?  or is his broken home (presumably) the remnant of myr tariniel?
- could the cthaeh's tree (a sweet smelling tree -- just like myrrh) be associated with myr tariniel?  and the cthaeh guarding it to prevent the release of the draugars?

# quotes
## feyda calanthis - the king of vint
why does the first king of vintas name start with "fey"?

"feyda" suggests he was fated to die or doomed.
> Master Lorren was pale and seemed unnaturally tall even while sitting. "Who was the first declared king of Tarvintas?"
>
> "Posthumously? Feyda Calanthis. Otherwise it would be his brother, Jarvis."

## never seen the king of vint
sooooo...did the people at the farm manage to bring the old barrow king and his draugr back from the dead?  is that why the chandrian where -- to kill them?  "i've never seen the king of vint either"
> She looked around, the bruise on her temple a sharp contrast against her pale skin. "I think when I'm done looking for my patron to be, I'm going to wash my hands of this place and never look back."
>
> "That's not an answer," I said. "What do you think happened?"
>
> She looked at me for a long moment before responding. "Something bad. I've never seen a demon, and I don't ever expect to. But I've never seen the King of Vint either...."

## salt the earth
lanre:
> Lanre turned. "And I counted among the best." Lanre's face was terrible to look upon. Grief and despair had ravaged it. "I, considered wise and good, did all this!" He gestured wildly. "Imagine what unholy things a lesser man must hold within his secret heart." Lanre faced Myr Tariniel and a sort of peace came over him. "For them, at least, it is over. They are safe. Safe from the thousand evils of the everyday. Safe from the pains of an unjust fate."
>
> Selitos spoke softly, "Safe from the joy and wonder..."
>
> "There is no joy!" Lanre shouted in an awful voice. Stones shattered at the sound and the sharp edges of echo came back to cut at them. "Any joy that grows here is quickly choked by weeds. I am not some monster who destroys out of a twisted pleasure. **I sow salt** because the choice is between weeds and nothing." Selitos saw nothing but emptiness behind his eyes.
>
> ...
>
> In spite of all that had happened, Selitos looked at Lanre with pity, and when he spoke it was with sadness in his voice. "Is there nothing then? No hope?" He lay one hand on Lanre's arm. "There is sweetness in life. Even after all of this, I will help you look for it. If you will try."
>
> "No," said Lanre. He stood to his full height, his face regal behind the lines of grief. "There is nothing sweet. **I will sow salt, lest the bitter weeds grow."**

vints think salt in the grass will kill a draugr:
> Because of this, the Vints gasped and made gestures before their faces. They thought he was a barrow draug, you see, one of the unquiet dead that superstitious Vints believe walk the night.
>
> Each of the Vints had a different thought as to how they could stop him. Some thought fire would frighten him off, some thought **salt scattered on the grass** would keep him away, some thought iron would cut the strings that held the soul to his dead body.

kvothe specifically compares the lackless box to a saltbox for some reason -- odd, considering lanre twice claimed to sow salt.  *could this be a hint that whoever was locked behind the box had been skinwalked/draugarized?*
> "It's lasted three thousand years," I mused aloud. "It's heavy despite being hollow. So it has to be a slow wood, like hornbeam or rennel. Its color and weight make me think it has a good deal of metal in it too, like roah. Probably iron and copper." I shrugged. "That's the best I can
> do."
> 
> "What's inside it?"
> 
> I thought for a long moment before saying anything. "**Something smaller than a saltbox ...**" I began. Meluan smiled, but Alveron gave the barest of frowns, so I hurried on. "Something metal, by the way the weight shifts when I tilt it." I closed my eyes and listened to the padded thump of its contents moving in the box. "No. By the weight of it, perhaps something made of glass or stone."
> 
> "Something precious," Alveron said.

meluan also (derogatorily) claims she'd rather salt her fields than open the box:
> "Have you ever considered simply cutting it open?" Alveron asked his wife.
> 
> Meluan looked every bit as horrified as I felt at the suggestion. "Never!" she said as soon as she caught her breath. "It is the very root of our family. **I would sooner think of salting every acre of our lands."**

to the fae, salting fields is a finality after war:
> "They attempt a daring moonlight escape," Kvothe continued. "But he falls from the rooftops and they're caught. The princess is married against her will and stabs the neighboring prince on their wedding night. The prince dies. Civil war. **Fields burned and salted**. Famine. Plague ..."
> 
> "That's the story of the Fastingsway War," Bast said faintly.
> 
> Kvothe nodded. "It's one of the stories Felurian told. I never understood the part about the flower until now. She never mentioned the Cthaeh."

more faen "salt the earth" as a finality after conflict:
> "The Sithe then," Chronicler said. "You said if they knew about this story, they'd kill everyone involved. Is that true?"
> 
> Bast nodded, eyes still on the fireplace. "They'd burn this place and **salt the earth behind them.**"
> 
> Chronicler looked down, shaking his head. "I don't understand this fear you have of the Cthaeh," he said.

bast has salt in him?
> As he spoke, Bast's eyes grew paler, until they were the pure blue of a clear noontime sky. "**I swear by all the salt in me**: if you run counter to my desire, the remainder of your brief mortal span will be an orchestra of misery. I swear by stone and oak and elm: I'll make a game of you. I'll follow you unseen and smother any spark of joy you find. You'll never know a woman's touch, a breath of rest, a moment's peace of mind."
and
> Bast ran his hands through his hair, leaving it in disarray. "I can't for all the salt in me guess how you slipped past them, Reshi.

why doesn't felurian like the idea of kvothe having salt on his skin?  is the idea that the salt rubbed off from felurian?
> "even the fish delight in kissing you," Felurian said, stepping closer to press her wet body against mine.
>
> "I think they must like **the salt on my skin**," I said, looking down at them.
>
> **She pushed me away, irritated**. "mayhap they like the taste of owl."

felurian swears by salt:
> "my sweet love," she said. "if you ask of the seven again in this place, I will drive you from it. no matter if your asking be firm or gentle, honest or slantways. if you ask, I will whip you forth from here with a lash of brambles and snakes. I will drive you before me, bloody and weeping, and will not stop until you are dead or fled from fae."
>
> She didn't look away from me as she spoke. And though I hadn't looked away or seen them change, her eyes were no longer soft with adoration. They were dark as storm clouds, hard as ice.
>
> "I do not jest," she said. "I swear this by my flower and the ever-moving moon. **I swear it by salt** and stone and sky. I swear this singing and laughing, by the sound of my own name." She kissed me again, pressing her lips to mine tenderly. "I will do this thing."

And that was the end of it. I might be a fool, but I am not that much of
a fool.
ruh salt (this is a common idiom though...):
> **No trouper worth his salt** could fail to recognize that.

interestingly, a (presumably) human sailor swears by all the salt in him.  this is one of many implied connections between faen stuff and sailors...
> "It were powerful strange," I heard the sailor say on the other side of the room. "There were sommat in his voice. **I swear by all the salt in me**, I felt like a puppet with my string pulled."

certainly this backwards saltwater river has some significance as well:
> "There's a river south of Vintas that flows the wrong way," Fenton said. "It's **a saltwater river** that runs inland from the Centhe Sea."
