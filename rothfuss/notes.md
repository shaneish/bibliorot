# amyr at the university
this is the revelation kvothe -- notorious for seeing the deeper truth without realizing it -- had right after meeting puppet.  interestingly, lorren came out to suspend *kvothe* for speaking in the library after he made this statement, yet *right* before this two other students were speaking even louder and lorren didn't prevent or punish them at all.

was kvothe kicked out because of *what* he said and not just for saying something?  is lorren trying to hide information about those who hide the amyr?
> However, I doubted Sim would appreciate my point. "Corrupt or not, he was a secret member of the Amyr. Why else would he hide their credo in the front cover of his journal?"
> 
> Simmon shrugged. "Fine, he was one of the Amyr. What does that have to do with the price of butter?"
> 
> I threw up my hands in frustration and struggled to keep my voice low. "That means the order had secret members *before* the church denounced them! That means when the pontifex disbanded them, the Amyr had hidden allies. Allies that could keep them safe. That means the Amyr could still exist today, in secret, pursuing their work in subtle ways."
> 
> I noticed a change in Simmon's face. At first I thought he was about to agree with me. Then I felt a prickle on the back of my neck and realized the truth. "Hello, Master Lorren," I greeted him respectfully without turning around.
> 
> "Speaking with students at other tables is not permitted," he said from behind me. "You are suspended for five days."

# tehlu shelter us -- hemme should be wearing a gram
"we should take all precautions."  the masters apparently know there is specific danger requiring use of a gram at all times against them.

could this be due to them helping the amyr guard *something* at the university?
> After a pause, the Chancellor raised his hand as well, saying "Five and a half in favor of Kvothe's admission to the Arcanum. Motion passed. Meeting dismissed. Tehlu shelter us, fools and children all." He said the last very softly as he rested his forehead against the heel of his hand.
> 
> Hemme stormed out of the room with Brandeur in tow. Once they were through the door I heard Brandeur ask, "Weren't you wearing a gram?"
> 
> "No, I wasn't." Hemme snapped. "And don't take that tone with me, as if this were my fault. You might as well blame someone stabbed in an alley for not wearing armor."
> 
> "We should all take precautions." Brandeur said, placatingly. "You know as well as---" Their voices were cut off with the sound of a door closing.

# how long had you intended to wait to cause trouble
this conversation between kvothe and the chancellor almost feels prophetic -- like the chancellor knows who kvothe is and that he's destined to cause them trouble.
> "I'm sorry to be so much trouble so soon, sir." I offered hesitantly.
>
> "Oh?" he said. His expression considerably less stern now that we were alone. "How long had you intended to wait?"
>
> ...
>
> I pushed the thought aside. "I imagine I'll heal, sir." He gave me an odd look, it took me a while to recognize it as the one I'd grown accustomed to in the troupe. He opened his mouth to speak, but I jumped on the words before he could say them. "I'm not as young as I look, sir. I know it. I just wish other people knew it, too."
>
> "I imagine they will before too long."

# tehlu guiding it
a few quotes with on-the-nose suggestions that kvothe is tehlu

trebon:
> A ton of wrought iron fell. If anyone had been watching, they would have noticed that the wheel fell faster than gravity could account for. They would have noticed that it fell at an angle, almost as if it were drawn to the draccus. Almost **as if Tehlu himself steered it** toward the beast with a vengeful hand.
> 
> But there was no one there to see the truth of things. And **there was no God guiding it. Only me.**

trebon:
> They knew beyond all certainty that the draccus was a demon. A huge black demon breathing fire and poison. If there had been any slim sliver of doubt as to that fact, it had been laid to rest when the beast had been struck down by Tehlu's own iron.

imre, when kvothe calls the name of the wind:
> Then all I could hear was the sound of the wind. It roared into the courtyard like a sudden storm. A nearby carriage slid sideways across the cobblestones, its horses rearing up in panic. Sheet music was torn from someone's hands to streak around us like strange lightning. I was pushed forward a step. Everyone was pushed by the wind. Everyone but Ambrose, who pinwheeled to the ground **as if struck by the hand of God.**

# myr tariniel -- not marinitel
could mirinitel and myr tariniel actually be separate cities?  shehyn calls it just "tariniel."
> "The city's name wasn't Mirinitel," I said without looking up. It was not the worst thing I could have said. But it wasn't the right thing to say.
> 
> There was a pause. "What?"
> 
> "Not Mirinitel," I repeated. "The city Lanre burned was Myr Tariniel.

the "every note of her song..." seems like a distinct reference to a palimpset.  could this indicate that denna's story about mirinitel was a repeat layered on top (or below) the burning of myr tariniel?  could marinitel be selito/jax's first home which was broken and myr tariniel be the new home built and repopulated with...*something*?
> But before ten lines had passed her lips I was stunned for different reasons. She sang the story of Myr Tariniel's fall. Of Lanre's betrayal. It was the story I had heard from Skarpi in Tarbean.
> 
> But Denna's version was different. In her song, Lanre was painted in tragic tones, a hero wrongly used. Selitos' words were cruel and biting, **Myr Tariniel a warren that was better for the purifying fire.** Lanre was no traitor, but a fallen hero.
> 
> So much depends upon where you stop a story, and hers ended when Lanre was cursed by Selitos. It was the perfect ending for a tragedy. In her story Lanre was wronged, misunderstood. Selitos was a tyrant, an insane monster who tore out his own eye in fury at Lanre's clever trickery. It was dreadfully, painfully wrong.
> 
> ...
> 
> I needed to say something. A compliment. A comment. A joke. A lie. Anything was better than silence.
> 
> But I couldn't have been more stunned if she had written *a hymn praising the Duke of Gibea.* The shock was simply too much for me. I felt raw as reused parchment, as if **every note of her song had been another flick of a knife, scraping until I was entirely blank and wordless.**

# the names of the seven and every fae child
so...the fae are frightened of the chandrian as well.  doesn't this suggest that it is their enemy who was on jax/iax's side?  does that not suggest the cthaeh is on the chandrian side?
> "RESHI!" BAST CRIED OUT, his face stricken. "No! Stop!" He held out his hands as if he would press them against the innkeeper's mouth. "You shouldn't say such things!"
> 
> Kvothe smiled in a humorless way. "Bast, who taught you your name lore in the first place?"
> 
> "Not you, Reshi." Bast shook his head. "There are things every Fae child knows. It's never good to speak such things aloud. Not ever."
> 
> "And why is that?" Kvothe prompted in his best teacher's voice.
> 
> "Because some things can tell when their names are spoken," Bast swallowed. "They can tell *where* they're spoken."
