# summary

there were demons who hid in men's bodies and made them sick or made, demons like great beasts that would catch and eat men alive, and skindancers, but one demon stood above the others -- encanis, swallowing darkness.  where he walked, shadows hid his face.

tehlu, who made the world and who is lord over all, watched the world of men.
(note: so did tehlu make and lord over the fae realm while watching the world of men?

tehlu appeared to perial in a dream -- stood before her and seemed to be made entirely of fire or sunlight.

tehlu then reborn as menda to perial, the only woman of pure of heart and spirit.

townspeople come to kill tehlu for being a demon

tehlu strikes townspeople with iron driving demons out

7 townspeople refused to join him, staying on the other side of the line

tehlu attacked them, one was a demon "wearing a man's skin" who tehlu "broke with his hands" and sent back to "the outer darkness that is the home of it's kind"

tehlu walks from town to town purifying each town.

"But there was one demon who eluded Tehlu. Encanis, whose face was all in shadow. Encanis, whose voice was like a knife in the minds of men. Wherever Tehlu stopped to offer men the choice of path, Encanis had been there just before, killing crops and poisoning wells. Encanis, setting men to murder one another and stealing children from their beds at night."

after 7 years, tehlu chased out all demons but encanis, so tehlu chased and encanis fled -- getting so close he could see where encanis' hands and feet had marked a "cold, black frost"
(
  note: interesting, in old cobb's story he had this to say about taborlin's amulet he got from the tinker:
    "It was black as a winter night and cold as ice to touch, but so long as it was round his neck, Taborlin would be safe from the harm of evil things. Demons and such."
  why would the amulet and encanis have the same signs?  and why would the amulet feel like a gram or a gilthe/guilder?
  was taborlin an agent for encanis?  are the masters?
)

knowing he was being chased, encanis came to a great city.  "The Lord of Demons" called forth his power and the city was brought to ruin. (tehlu referred to as "the walking god")

"For six days Encanis fled, and six great cities he destroyed. But on the seventh day, Tehlu drew near before Encanis could bring his power to bear and the seventh city was saved. That is why seven is a lucky number, and why we celebrate on Caenin."

"On the eighth day Tehlu did not pause to sleep or eat. And thus it was that at the end of Felling Tehlu caught Encanis. He leaped on the demon and struck him with his forge hammer. Encanis fell like a stone, but Tehlu's hammer shattered and lay in the dust of the road."

tehlu carried the demon through the night and on came to city of atur on morning of 9th day

dudes thought encanis was dead in tehlu's arms -- but tehlu knew such a thing was not easily done.  no blade or blow could kill him, no cell of bars hold him

tehlu carried encanis to the smithy and called for iron, 10 men worked the bellows (tehlu on no food or sleep) while tehlu forged *the* great iron wheel.  the wheel:
- stood taller than a man
- w/ 6 spokes thicker than a hammer's haft
- a rim a handspan across
- weight as much as 40 men
- was cold to the touch
- and had a terrible sounding name none could speak

tehlu had a priest and people dig a big 15ft x 20ft great pit in center of town

tehlu put demon on wheel and, at first touch, encanis began to wake.  tehlu chained him tightly to wheel, hammering the links together, sealing them tighter than any lock
(note: hammering the links together?  so no lock at all?  a lockless box?)

tehlu stepped back and saw encanis shift, as if disturbed by unpleasant dream

encanis shook and woke, strained against chains, body arching upward away as he pulled on them.  where iron touched his skin it felt like knives and needles and nails, the searing pain of frost, the sting of a hundred biting flies

encanis began to howl as iron burned and bit and *froze* him, which sounded like sweet music to tehlu
(note: froze eh?)

tehlu layed down next to ground beside wheel and slept a deep sleep for he was very tired
(note: tehlu *slept* after this?  could that be a skindancer jumping to tehlu?)

tehlu woke in the evening of the 10th day.  encanis still bound to wheel, but no longer howled and fought like trapped animal

tehlu bent and lifted one edge of wheel, leaning it against a nearby tree -- all while encanis cursed him in unknown "language*s*", scratching, and biting

"you brought this on yourself" - "tehlu" to "encanis"

celebration that night, tehlu had a dozen men cut evergreens to kindle a bonfire in the pit.  townsfolk danced and sang around fire all night, they "knew" the last/most dangerous of world's demons was finally caught.  encanis hung from wheel and watching, motionless as a "snake"

morning of 11th day, tehlu went to encanis a 3rd time -- "the demon" looked worn and feral, skin was sallow, bones pressed tight against his skin, but his power lay around him like a dark mantle, hiding his face in shadow

"encanis, this is your last chance to speak.  do it for i know it is within your power" - tehlu
(note: this almost sounds like when lanre bound selitos and then he was able to speak after myr tariniel burned down -- could the pit in the ground represent myr tariniel??)

"**Lord Tehlu, I am not Encanis.**" - bro tied to wheel.  **briefly the demon's voice was pitiful, all who heard it were moved to sorrow** -- but then there was a sound like quenching iron and the wheel rung like an iron bell.  encanis' body arched painfully at the sound and hung limply from his wrists as the ringing of the wheel faded.
(note: so the skindancer *could've* jumped and left whoever it was back in their body)

"try no tricks, dark one.  speak no lines" - tehlu, sternly, eyes as dark and hard as the iron of the wheel
(note: so dark, hard eyes now?  are dark, hard eyes a sign of being skindanced?)

"what then? what? rack and shatter you, what do you want of me?" - "encanis," voice like the rasp of stone on stone

"Your road is very short, Encanis. But you may still choose a side on which to travel."

encanis laughed: "You will give me the same choice you give the cattle? Yes then, I will cross to your side of the path, I regret and rep---"
(note: same choice as the humans, eh?  i will cross to your "side of the path" -- so cross to the moral realm?)

the wheel rung again, like a great bell tolling long and deep.  encanis threw body tight against chains and **his scream shook the *earth* and shattered stones for half a mile in each direction**
(
  note: the earth you say?  not "temerant"?  have we seen evidence of a large crater anywhere?

  we know what bast said about the cthaeh: "If anyone manages to come in contact with the Cthaeh, the Sithe kill them. They kill them from a half-mile off with their long horn bows."

  does this mean that "encanis" and tehlu are buried in the middle of the cthaeh field? is the cthaeh and the tree it's own tehlu and encanis?
)

"I told you to speak no lie, Encanis" - "tehlu", pitiless

"My path then!" Encanis shrieked. "I do not regret! If I had my choice again, I would only change how fast I ran. Your people are like cattle my kind feed on! Bite and break you, if you gave me half an hour I would do such things that these wretched gawping peasants would go mad with fear. I would drink their children's blood and bathe in women's tears."
(note: "your people are like cattle my kind feed on!" - is this a skindancer reference?  or more?  could "your people" refer to dreamworld thoughts/ideas?)

"so" - "tehlu", stepping closer to the wheel.  almost looked like he'd hug ol' bro, but then reached for iron spokes of wheel, strained, lifted wheel above head, carried to pit, and threw "encanis" in.

flames from dozen evergreens died down in morning, leaving a bed of coals that glimmered as *the wind* brushed them.

wheel lands with encanis on top, explosion of spark and ash as it sank into hot coals, encanis held over coals by iron that *bound and burned and bit* at him.
(note: encanis almost seems like cinder here or something -- that would explain the name, although it was tehlu w/ the dark eyes.  no wait, could tehlu be cinder??)

though held away from the fire itself, heat was so intense that encanis' clothes charred black and began to crumble without bursting into flame.
(note: how was he held away from the fire exactly?  also, this sounds even more like cinder)

*demon* thrashed against bonds, getting *him* even more stuck.  *encanis* screamed, because *he* knew that even *demons* can die from fire or iron and -- though *he* was powerful -- *he* was bound and burning. *he* felt the metal of the wheel grow hot beneath *him*, blackening the flesh of *his* arms and legs.  *encanis* screamed and even *his* skin began to smoke and char, face still hidden in a shadow that rose from *him* like a tongue of darkening flame.
(
  note: why does this almost read like encanis and the demon are distinct entities?  "even his skin began to smoke" makes it sound like the body the demon possessed was fucked -- was cinder simply a body possessed by the demon?  why are we seeing all 7 signs of the chandrian appear from this single demon?  It reminds me of Jake's words at the beginning of the book:
    "Tell this damn fool the difference between a demon and a dog \[encanis]."
)

*encanis* grew silent, the only sound was the hiss of sweat and blood as *they* feel from the demon's straining limbs.

for a long moment, everything was still

*encanis* strained against the chains that held *him* to the wheel, it seemed that *he* would strain until *his* muscles tore themselves from bone and sinew both.

sharp sound like bell breaking and *demon*'s arm jerked free of the wheel.  links of chain, now growing red from the heat of the fire, flew upward to land smoking at the feet of those who stood above.
(note: it still kinda sounds like the demon and encanis are separate entities here)

the only sound was the sudden, wild laughter of encanis, like breaking glass.
(note: kinda like the sound of broken glass when kvothe got mad at chronicler?)

in a moment, *demon*'s 2nd hand was free, but before *he* could do more, tehlu flung himself into the pit -- landed w/ such for the iron rang with it.

tehlu grabbed the hands of the *demon* and pressed them back against the wheel.

*encanis* screamed in fury and disbelief, for though he was forced back onto burning wheel and felt the strength of tehlu was greater than chains *he* had broken, he saw tehlu was burning in the flames

"fool!" - *he* (demon, encanis, etc) wailed, "you will die here with me.  let me go and live.  let me go and i will trouble you no further"

and the wheel did not ring out, for *encanis* was truly frightened
(note: so should we be looking for a ringing noise in the books?  does the ringing tell you when encanis is around and lying?)

"no" - tehlu.  "your punishment is death.  you will serve it"
(note: interesting that "serve it" is used here, as if death is but time spent in time out)

"fool! madling!" - *encanis* thrashed to no avail.  "you are burning in the flames with me, you will die as i do!"

"To ash all things return, so too this flesh will burn. But I am Tehlu. Son of myself. Father of myself. I was before, and I will be after. If I am a sacrifice then it is to myself alone. And if I am needed and called in the proper ways then I will come again to judge and punish."
(
  note: reminds me of the biblical phrase "repent in dust and ashes," signifying remorse and humility.
  - what does it mean "to ash all things return" though?  are all things made by ash like golems? or is it symbolic?
  - "son of myself, father of myself" - kinda jesus-y vibes, right?  but off a bit.
  - "i was before and i will be after" - before and after what, exactly?  the end of the mythological cycle?
  - "if i am a sacrifice then it is to myself alone" - now this is the weird part, where the jesus-y vibes fall apart.  because for jesus, he was a sacrifice to mankind, but here it's almost as if telhu is saying *he is* mankind -- or that he's not sacrificing himself to save the people from encanis...
  - "if i am needed and called in the proper ways i will come *again* to judge and punish" - ahhhh, so this story must be *after* aleph turned tehlu into an angel, *after* selitos created the amyr.  how does that affect the chronology?
  - what are the "proper ways" exactly? is tehlu coming back to judge and punish *the fae*??
)

tehlu held him to the burning wheel and none of the *demon*'s threats or screaming moved him the least part of an inch.

so it was that *encanis* passed from the world and with him tehlu who was menda.  both of them burned to ash in the pit in atur.
(note: ok, so...what does "passed" from the world mean exactly?  passed to another realm?  also, it seems weird that the half mile radius matches up with the cthaeh so well if this happened in "atur" -- could temerant's "aturian empire" be a human knockoff?  just like the human amyr were for the real amyr?)

that is why the tehlin priests wear robes of ashen grey, and how we know tehlu cares for us, and watches us, and keeps us safe from---
(note: from...? from what?  the sentence ended too abruptly for me think the answer was "encanis" tbh, surely there was a deeper enemy there)

# story
This is a story from long ago. Back before any of us were born. Before
our fathers were born, too. It was a long time ago. Maybe---maybe four
hundred years. No, more than that. Probably a thousand years. But maybe
not quite as much as that.

It was a bad time in the world. People were hungry and sick. There were
famines and great plagues. There were many wars and other bad things in
this time, because there was no one to stop them.

But the worst thing in this time was that there were demons walking the
land. Some of them were small and troublesome, creatures who lamed
horses and spoiled milk. But there were many worse than those.

There were demons who hid in men's bodies and made them sick or mad, but
those were not the worst. There were demons like great beasts that would
catch and eat men while they were still alive and screaming, but they
were not the worst. Some demons stole the skins of men and wore them
like clothes, but even they were not the worst.

There was one demon that stood above the others. Encanis, the swallowing
darkness. No matter where he walked, shadows hid his face, and scorpions
that stung him died of the corruption they had touched.

Now Tehlu, who made the world and who is lord over all, watched the
world of men. He saw that demons made sport of us and killed us and ate
our bodies. Some men he saved, but only a few. For Tehlu is just and
saves only the worthy, and in these times few men acted even for their
own good, let alone the good of others.

Because of this, Tehlu was unhappy. For he had made the world to be a
good place for men to live. But his church was corrupt. They stole from
the poor and did not live by the laws he had given....

No, wait. There was no church yet, and no priests either. Just men and
women, and some of them knew who Tehlu was. But even those were wicked,
so when they called on Lord Tehlu for help he felt no desire to aid
them.

But after years of watching and waiting, Tehlu saw a woman pure of heart
and spirit. Her name was Perial. Her mother had raised her to know
Tehlu, and she worshiped him as well as her poor circumstances allowed.
Although her own life was hard, Perial prayed only for others, and never
for herself.

Tehlu watched her for long years. He saw her life was hard, full of
misfortune and torment at the hands of demons and bad men. But she never
cursed his name or ceased her praying, and she never treated any person
other than with kindness and respect.

So late one night, Tehlu went to her in a dream. He stood before her,
and seemed to be made entirely of fire or sunlight. He came to her in
splendor and asked her if she knew who he was.

"Sure enough," she said. You see, she was very calm about it because she
thought she was just having an odd dream. "You're Lord Tehlu."

He nodded and asked her if she knew why he had come to her.

"Are you going to do something for my neighbor Deborah?" she asked.
Because that's who she had prayed for before she went to sleep. "Are you
going to lay your hand on her husband Losel and make him a better man?
The way he treats her isn't right. Man should never lay a hand on woman,
save in love."

Tehlu knew her neighbors. He knew they were wicked people who had done
wicked things. Everyone in the village was wicked but her. Everyone in
the world was. He told her so.

"Deborah has been very kind and good to me," Perial said. "And even
Losel, who I don't care for, is one of my neighbors all the same."

Tehlu told her that Deborah spent time in many different men's beds, and
Losel drank every day of the week, even on Mourning. No, wait---there
wasn't any Mourning yet. But he drank a lot at any rate. Sometimes he
grew so angry that he beat his wife until she could not stand or even
cry aloud.

Perial was quiet for a long moment in her dream. She knew Tehlu spoke
the truth, but while Perial was pure of heart, she was not a fool. She
had suspected her neighbors of doing the things Tehlu said. Even now
that she knew for certain, she cared for her neighbors all the same.
"You won't help her?"

Tehlu said that the man and wife were each other's fitting punishment.
They were wicked and the wicked should be punished.

Perial spoke out honestly, perhaps because she thought she was dreaming,
but perhaps she would have said the same thing had she been awake, for
Perial said what was in her heart. "It's not their fault that the world
is full of hard choices and hunger and loneliness," she said. "What can
you expect of people when demons are their neighbors?"

But though Tehlu listened to her wise words with his ears, he told her
that mankind was wicked, and the wicked should be punished.

"I think you know very little about what it is to be a man," she said.
"And I would still help them if I could," she told him resolutely.

SO YOU SHALL, Tehlu told her, and reached out to lay his hand on her
heart. When he touched her she felt like she were a great golden bell
that had just rung out its first note. She opened her eyes and knew then
that it had been no normal dream.

Thus it was that she was not surprised to discover she was pregnant. In
three months she gave birth to a perfect dark-eyed baby boy. She named
him Menda. The day after he was born, Menda could crawl. In two days he
could walk. Perial was surprised, but not worried, for she knew the
child was a gift from God.

Nevertheless, Perial was wise. She knew that people might not
understand. So she kept Menda close by her, and when her friends and
neighbors came to visit, she sent them away.

But this could only last a little while, for in a small town there are
no secrets. Folk knew that Perial was not married. And while children
born out of wedlock were common during this time, children who grew to
manhood in less than two months were not. They were afraid that she
might have lain down with a demon, and that her child was a demon's
child. Such things were not unheard of in those dark times, and the
people were afraid.

So everyone gathered together on the first day of the seventh span, and
made their way to the tiny house where Perial lived by herself with her
son. The town smith, whose name was Rengen, led them. "Show us the boy,"
he yelled. But there was no response from the house. "Bring out the boy,
and show us he is nothing but a human child."

The house remained quiet, and though there were many men among them, no
one wanted to enter a house that might have a demon's child inside. So
the smith cried out again, "Perial, bring out young Menda, or we will
burn your house around you."

The door opened, and a man stepped out. None of them recognized who it
was, because even though he was only seven span from the womb, Menda
looked to be a young man of seventeen. He stood proud and tall, with
coal-black hair and eyes. "I am the one you think is Menda," he said in
a voice both powerful and deep. "What do you want of me?"

The sound of his voice made Perial gasp inside the cottage. Not only was
this the first time Menda had ever spoken, but she recognized his voice
as the same one that had spoken to her in a dream, months ago.

"What do you mean, we think you are Menda?" asked the smith, gripping
his hammer tightly. He knew that there were demons that looked like men,
or wore their skins like costumes, the way a man might hide beneath a
sheepskin.

The child who was not a child spoke again. "I am Perial's son, but I am
not Menda. And I am not a demon."

"Touch the iron of my hammer then," said Rengen, for he knew all demons
feared two things, cold iron and clean fire. He held out his heavy forge
hammer. It shook in his hands, but no one thought the less of him for
it.

He who was not Menda stepped forward and lay both hands on the iron head
of the hammer. Nothing happened. From the doorway of her house where she
watched, Perial burst into tears, for though she trusted Tehlu, some
part of her had held a mother's worry for her son.

"I am not Menda, though that is what my mother called me. I am Tehlu,
lord above all. I have come to free you from demons and the wickedness
of your own hearts. I am Tehlu, son of myself. Let the wicked hear my
voice and tremble."

And they did tremble. But some of them refused to believe. They called
him a demon and threatened him. They spoke hard, frightened words. Some
threw stones and cursed him, and spat toward him and his mother.

Then Tehlu grew angry, and he might have slain them all, but Perial
leaped forward and laid a restraining hand on his shoulder. "What more
can you expect?" she asked him quietly. "From men who live with demons
for their neighbors? Even the best dog will bite that has been kicked
enough."

Tehlu considered her words and saw that she was wise. So he looked over
his hands at Rengen, looked deep into his heart and said, "Rengen, son
of Engen, you have a mistress who you pay to lie with you. Some men come
to you for work and you cheat or steal from them. And though you pray
loudly, you do not believe I, Tehlu, made the world and watch over all
who live here."

When Rengen heard this, he grew pale and dropped his hammer to the
ground. For what Tehlu said to him was true. Tehlu looked at all the men
and women there. He looked into their hearts and spoke of what he saw.
All of them were wicked, so much that Rengen was among the best of them.

Then Tehlu drew a line in the dirt of the road so that it lay between
himself and all those who had come. "This road is like the meandering
course of a life. There are two paths to take, side by side. Each of you
are already traveling that side. You must choose. Stay on your own path,
or cross to mine."

"But the road is the same, isn't it? It still goes to the same place,"
someone asked.

"Yes."

"Where does the road lead?"

"Death. All lives end in death, excepting one. Such is the way of
things."

"Then what does it matter which side a man is on?" It was Rengen asking
these questions. He was a large man, one of the few that was taller than
dark-eyed Tehlu. But he was shaken by all that he had seen and heard in
the past few hours. "What is on our side of the road?"

"Pain," Tehlu said in a voice as hard and cold as stone. "Punishment."

"And your side?"

"Pain now," Tehlu said in the same voice. "Punishment now, for all that
you have done. It cannot be avoided. But I am here too, this is my
path."

"How do I cross?"

"Regret, repent, and cross to me."

Rengen stepped over the line to stand beside his God. Then Tehlu bent to
pick up the hammer that the smith had dropped. But instead of giving it
back, he struck Rengen with it as if it were a lash. Once. Twice.
Thrice. And the third blow sent Rengen to his knees sobbing and crying
out in pain. But after the third blow, Tehlu laid the hammer aside and
knelt to look Rengen in the face. "You were the first to cross," he said
softly so only the smith could hear. "It was a brave thing, a hard thing
to do. I am proud of you. You are no longer Rengen, now you are Wereth,
the forger of the path." Then Tehlu embraced him with both arms, and his
touch took much of the pain from Rengen who was now Wereth. But not all,
for Tehlu spoke truly when he said that punishment cannot be avoided.

One by one they crossed, and one by one Tehlu struck them down with the
hammer. But after each man or woman fell, Tehlu knelt and spoke to them,
giving them new names and healing some of their hurt.

Many of the men and women had demons hiding inside them that fled
screaming when the hammer touched them. These people Tehlu spoke with a
while longer, but he always embraced them in the end, and they were all
grateful. Some of them danced for the joy of being free of such terrible
things living inside them.

In the end, seven stayed on the other side of the line. Tehlu asked them
three times if they would cross, and three times they refused. After the
third asking Tehlu sprang across the line and he struck each of them a
great blow, driving them to the ground.

But not all were men. When Tehlu struck the fourth, there was the sound
of quenching iron and the smell of burning leather. For the fourth man
had not been a man at all, but a demon wearing a man's skin. When it was
revealed, Tehlu grabbed the demon and broke it in his hands, cursing its
name and sending it back to the outer darkness that is the home of its
kind.

The remaining three let themselves be struck down. None of them were
demons, though demons fled the bodies of some who fell. After he was
done, Tehlu did not speak to the six who did not cross, nor did he kneel
to embrace them and ease their wounds.

The next day, Tehlu set off to finish what he had begun. He walked from
town to town, offering each village he met the same choice he had given
before. Always the results were the same, some crossed, some stayed,
some were not men at all but demons, and those he destroyed.

But there was one demon who eluded Tehlu. Encanis, whose face was all in
shadow. Encanis, whose voice was like a knife in the minds of men.

Wherever Tehlu stopped to offer men the choice of path, Encanis had been
there just before, killing crops and poisoning wells. Encanis, setting
men to murder one another and stealing children from their beds at
night.

At the end of seven years, Tehlu's feet had carried him all through the
world. He had driven out the demons that plagued us. All but one.
Encanis ran free and did the work of a thousand demons, destroying and
despoiling wherever he went.

So Tehlu chased and Encanis fled. Soon Tehlu was a span of days behind
the demon, then two days, then half a day. Finally he was so close he
felt the chill of Encanis' passing and could spy places where he had set
his hands and feet, for they were marked with a cold, black frost.

Knowing he was pursued, Encanis came to a great city. The Lord of Demons
called forth his power and the city was brought to ruin. He did this
hoping Tehlu would delay so he could make his escape, but the Walking
God paused only to appoint priests who cared for the people of the
ruined town.

For six days Encanis fled, and six great cities he destroyed. But on the
seventh day, Tehlu drew near before Encanis could bring his power to
bear and the seventh city was saved. That is why seven is a lucky
number, and why we celebrate on Caenin.

Encanis was now hard pressed and bent his whole thought upon escape. But
on the eighth day Tehlu did not pause to sleep or eat. And thus it was
that at the end of Felling Tehlu caught Encanis. He leaped on the demon
and struck him with his forge hammer. Encanis fell like a stone, but
Tehlu's hammer shattered and lay in the dust of the road.

Tehlu carried the demon's limp body all through the long night, and on
the morning of the ninth day he came to the city of Atur. When men saw
Tehlu carrying the demon's senseless form, they thought Encanis dead.
But Tehlu knew that such a thing was not easily done. No simple blade or
blow could kill him. No cell of bars could keep him safe within.

So Tehlu carried Encanis to the smithy. He called for iron, and people
brought all they owned. Though he had taken no rest nor a morsel of
food, all through the ninth day Tehlu labored. While ten men worked the
bellows, Tehlu forged the great iron wheel.

All night he worked, and when the first light of the tenth morning
touched him, Tehlu struck the wheel one final time and it was finished.
Wrought all of black iron, the wheel stood taller than a man. It had six
spokes, each thicker than a hammer's haft, and its rim was a handspan
across. It weighed as much as forty men, and was cold to the touch. The
sound of its name was terrible, and none could speak it.

Tehlu gathered the people who were watching and chose a priest among
them. Then he set them to dig a great pit in the center of the town,
fifteen feet wide and twenty feet deep.

With the sun rising Tehlu laid the body of the demon on the wheel. At
the first touch of iron, Encanis began to stir in his sleep. But Tehlu
chained him tightly to the wheel, hammering the links together, sealing
them tighter than any lock.

Then Tehlu stepped back, and all saw Encanis shift again, as if
disturbed by an unpleasant dream. Then he shook and came awake entirely.
Encanis strained against the chains, his body arching upward as he
pulled against them. Where the iron touched his skin it felt like knives
and needles and nails, like the searing pain of frost, like the sting of
a hundred biting flies. Encanis thrashed on the wheel and began to howl
as the iron burned and bit and froze him.

To Tehlu the sound was like a sweet music. He lay down on the ground
beside the wheel and slept a deep sleep, for he was very tired.

When he awoke, it was evening of the tenth day. Encanis was still bound
to the wheel, but he no longer howled and fought like a trapped animal.
Tehlu bent and with great effort lifted one edge of the wheel and set it
leaning against a tree that grew nearby. As soon as he came close,
Encanis cursed him in languages no one knew, scratching and biting.

"You brought this on yourself," Tehlu said.

That night there was a celebration. Tehlu sent men to cut a dozen
evergreens and use them to kindle a bonfire in the bottom of the deep
pit they had dug.

All night the townsfolk danced and sang around the burning fire. They
knew the last and most dangerous of the world's demons was finally
caught.

And all night Encanis hung from his wheel and watched them, motionless
as a snake.

When the morning of the eleventh day came, Tehlu went to Encanis a third
and final time. The demon looked worn and feral. His skin was sallow and
his bones pressed tight against his skin. But his power still lay around
him like a dark mantle, hiding his face in shadow.

"Encanis," Tehlu said. "This is your last chance to speak. Do it, for I
know it is within your power."

"Lord Tehlu, I am not Encanis." For that brief moment the demon's voice
was pitiful, and all who heard it were moved to sorrow. But then there
was a sound like quenching iron, and the wheel rung like an iron bell.
Encanis' body arched painfully at the sound then hung limply from his
wrists as the ringing of the wheel faded.

"Try no tricks, dark one. Speak no lies," Tehlu said sternly, his eyes
as dark and hard as the iron of the wheel.

"What then?" Encanis hissed, his voice like the rasp of stone on stone.
"What? Rack and shatter you, what do you want of me?"

"Your road is very short, Encanis. But you may still choose a side on
which to travel."

Encanis laughed. "You will give me the same choice you give the cattle?
Yes then, I will cross to your side of the path, I regret and rep---"

The wheel rung again, like a great bell tolling long and deep. Encanis
threw his body tight against the chains again and the sound of his
scream shook the earth and shattered stones for half a mile in each
direction.

When the sounds of wheel and scream had faded, Encanis hung panting and
shaking from his chains. "I told you to speak no lie, Encanis," Tehlu
said, pitiless.

"My path then!" Encanis shrieked. "I do not regret! If I had my choice
again, I would only change how fast I ran. Your people are like cattle
my kind feed on! Bite and break you, if you gave me half an hour I would
do such things that these wretched gawping peasants would go mad with
fear. I would drink their children's blood and bathe in women's tears."
He might have said more, but his breath was short as he strained against
the chains that held him.

"So," Tehlu said, and stepped close to the wheel. For a moment it seemed
like he would embrace Encanis, but he was merely reaching for the iron
spokes of the wheel. Then, straining, Tehlu lifted the wheel above his
head. He carried it, arms upstretched, toward the pit, and threw Encanis
in.

Through the long hours of night, a dozen evergreens had fed the fire.
The flames had died in the early morning, leaving a deep bed of sullen
coals that glimmered when the wind brushed them.

The wheel struck flat, with Encanis on top. There was an explosion of
spark and ash as it landed and sank inches deep into the hot coals.
Encanis was held over the coals by the iron that bound and burned and
bit at him.

Though he was held away from the fire itself, the heat was so intense
that Encanis' clothes charred black and began to crumble without
bursting into flame. The demon thrashed against his bonds, settling the
wheel more firmly into the coals. Encanis screamed, because he knew that
even demons can die from fire or iron. And though he was powerful, he
was bound and burning. He felt the metal of the wheel grow hot beneath
him, blackening the flesh of his arms and legs. Encanis screamed, and
even as his skin began to smoke and char, his face was still hidden in a
shadow that rose from him like a tongue of darkening flame.

Then Encanis grew silent, and the only sound was the hiss of sweat and
blood as they fell from the demon's straining limbs. For a long moment
everything was still. Encanis strained against the chains that held him
to the wheel, and it seemed that he would strain until his muscles tore
themselves from bone and sinew both.

Then there was a sharp sound like a bell breaking and the demon's arm
jerked free of the wheel. Links of chain, now glowing red from the heat
of the fire, flew upward to land smoking at the feet of those who stood
above. The only sound was the sudden, wild laughter of Encanis, like
breaking glass.

In a moment the demon's second hand was free, but before he could do
more, Tehlu flung himself into the pit and landed with such force that
the iron rang with it. Tehlu grabbed the hands of the demon and pressed
them back against the wheel.

Encanis screamed in fury and in disbelief, for though he was forced back
onto the burning wheel, and though he felt the strength of Tehlu was
greater than chains he had broken, he saw Tehlu was burning in the
flames.

"Fool!" he wailed. "You will die here with me. Let me go and live. Let
me go and I will trouble you no further." And the wheel did not ring
out, for Encanis was truly frightened.

"No," said Tehlu. "Your punishment is death. You will serve it."

"Fool! Madling!" Encanis thrashed to no avail. "You are burning in the
flames with me, you will die as I do!"

"To ash all things return, so too this flesh will burn. But I am Tehlu.
Son of myself. Father of myself. I was before, and I will be after. If I
am a sacrifice then it is to myself alone. And if I am needed and called
in the proper ways then I will come again to judge and punish."

So Tehlu held him to the burning wheel, and none of the demon's threats
or screaming moved him the least part of an inch. So it was that Encanis
passed from the world, and with him went Tehlu who was Menda. Both of
them burned to ash in the pit in Atur. That is why the Tehlin priests
wear robes of ashen grey. And that is how we know Tehlu cares for us,
and watches us, and keeps us safe from---

 

Trapis broke off his story as Jaspin began to howl and thrash against
his restraints. I slid softly back into unconsciousness as soon as I no
longer had the story to hold my attention.

After that, I began to harbor a suspicion that never entirely left me.
Was Trapis a Tehlin priest? His robe was tattered and dirty, but it
might have been the proper grey long ago. Parts of his story had been
awkward and stumbling, but some were stately and grand, as if he had
been reciting them from some half-forgotten memory. Of sermons? Of his
readings from the *Book of the Path?*

I never asked. And though I stopped by his basement frequently in the
months that followed, I never heard Trapis tell another story again.
