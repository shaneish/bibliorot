*Seven things has Lady Lackless*
*Keeps them underneath her black dress*
*One a ring that's not for wearing*
*One a sharp word, not for swearing*
*Right beside her husband's candle*
*There's a door without a handle*
*In a box, no lid or locks*
*Lackless keeps her husband's rocks*
*There's a secret she's been keeping*
*She's been dreaming and not sleeping*
*On a road, that's not for traveling*
*Lackless likes her riddle raveling."*
