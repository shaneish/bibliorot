#### TL;DR
So, the **TL;DR** of it is that I think 1) Adonalsium is not the God itself, 2) that the God associated with Adonalsium has it's powers hidden under the Shattered Plains, and that 3) that is the pool of which Mishram drank.  I'll also throw in a quick few hints about how **all** of the aspects of the gods (vessel, shard, metal/well of power) we see in the Cosmere map directly back to the Christian God (via the Trinity and transubstantiation) -- but I won't go into too many details, I just think it's cool and painfully obvious once you spot it.

There will be a postscript with wild speculations about the **Dawn**, from which the Dawnshards split from -- and where my theorizing is prolly off a bit.  Needless to say, the Dawnsingers prolly are called Dawnsingers because they were created to Herald in the Dawn of a new era in which the power of the One God had been split into 16.  This also has Christian undertones, which we'll get to.

#### Overview
I'll start with 2) and 3) as they are directly related to WaT and less speculative than 1), but from here on out I will refer to the singular God of the Cosmere (the one associated with Adonalsium and, arguably, the one Dalinar and Vo both interacted with) "Creation" just to reduce ambiguity between Adonalsium (the God metal) and Creation (the power/Shard) going forwards.  Also, presumably the vessel is named Adonai (you know, the Hebrew word for "Lord" that Jews use for God), but that's not relevant here.  This combination is what I think the "Seventeenth Shard" that Frost's organization calls itself is referring to -- the original One God of Creation, which Frost believes will eventually come back if the current Shards are left alone to experience life on their own.

I do not think it coincidence that all "gods" in the Cosmere have this Christinity-based Triune (Trinity) relationship, where there is the Shard, the vessel, and the physical manifestation ("God Metal" and "well of power").  I'll go into more details in section 3), but I just to get you thinking about the many implications as you go through this.

#### 2. Where Creation's pool at brah
My guess is that Creation's well of power is hidden under the Shattered Plains.  When Honor and Odium clashed, the shattered plains split open and Honor saw:
> I saw people there -- new ones, watchers, who had hidden from me.
Those pieces of the sky...they sheltered from the eyes of God?  That was not aluminum.  It was something greater.  Something...that responded to our clash, the ground liquefying in a pattern, dictated by the ton and the strange nature of the place.

Guardians hidden from the eyes of Honor and Odium themselves?  Hidden by pieces of the broken moon that shattered the Shattered Plains?  Power that responds to the clash of Shard's themselves?  Golly gee, I wonder what could be that powerful?

I think you all see where I'm going with this, but -- to me, at least -- it seems like maybe the remnant of Creation's well of power was stored on the moon that crashed into Roshar.  I believe that Odium, after seeing this during the conflict, then decided to place his well of power above this hidden power to shield what was truly there.

We also know that the moon that crashed into the Shattered Plains crashed there before Honor and Cultivation showed up to Roshar, so if I was a betting man I'd guess that the moon shattered the plains when the 16 shattered Adonalsium (see the poetic nature of that -- Brandon loves ish like that).

#### 3. Mishram drank the blood of Christ (not Odium) (slurp slurp)
We all know Mishram drank from *a* well of power hidden underground and we're *led to believe* it was Odium's well -- but, how would drinking Odium's power give Mishram power over the sapiant Spren?  We know those are of Honor alone (well, one or two also of Cultivation).  Mishram's imprisoment made deadeye spren, but Odium only has power of **Unmade** spren (which is why they're called Unmade).  However, Mishram could also grant Singers forms of power, which are associated with Odium.  How could Mishram gain a hint of the power of both Honor and Odium?  Also, another thing to consider is how fishy it is that Mishram was able to hide people from Odium in her visions in the spiritual realm.

Mishram also had an effect on the Wind, which we know pre-dates both Honor and Odium.  To me, this seems like Mishram drank a different power that's greater than just Odium -- and I suspect that that is the well of power of Creation itself (the Shard associated with Adonalsium) hidden on Roshar.

It was said that Mishram's power could threaten Odium itself, but how could that be if Mishram drank only of Odium's power?  Nowhere else in the Cosmere do we see people able to threaten the Shards themselves with a little bit of their own power.  Odium's power thirsts after Mishram -- and we are led to believe it's due to her nature, but we also know that Mishram was actually very honorable and willing to make a deal with the humans, so not very odiuous to me.  Rather, I think Odium's power thirsts after Mishram for the same reason the Dawnshards are uncontrollably drawn to each other -- they are of the same power and they want to be one.  Mishram drank of the ultimate power of the Cosmere -- and the power of Odium wants that ish bad bro.

Also, ask yourself why **Ado**nalsium and Ba-**Ado**-Mishram both have "Ado" in their name?  That's not a coincidence, that's a hint -- and Brandon loves that ish too.  He's literally sticking your face in it some you can come back and smack yourself for not seeing it.

#### 1. Adonalsium ain't a God, bruh -- and the shattering of Adonalsium was just big boy version of Wax shattering Harmonium and making himself a Mistborn
I think it's clear from the name that Adonalsium is a "God metal" and not a God, let's be real here.  That's not a coincidence either.  When I first got into the Cosmere, I thought it was so weird that Brandon would take an obvious reference to the biblical God and slap "-sium", which just seems tacky to me -- but now, I don't think that's the case.  It's a misdirection, there is an actual God/Shard held by a being named Adonai and Adonalsium is no more the God than Atium was Ruin.  I think this is fairly well establish in Cosmere lore by this point, so I won't harp on it.

I've referenced this above, but just for clarity sake I will break down the exact relationship between the Trinity and the God/gods of the Cosmere.  Each God/gods has three components that map to the Trinity and one subcomponent that maps to Christ.  Additionally, these three Triune components map to the three realms of the Cosmere:
+ **The Shard**
  - This is the power of a God/gods
  - Represented in the spiritual realm
  - This God, yo
+ **The Vessel**
  - This is the wielder of the power which influences the world
  - Represented in the cognitive realm
  - This the Holy Spirit, yo
+ **The Physical Manifestation** (please give me a better name for this, I'm too dumb to come up with something)
  - This is the physical manifestation of the power
  - Represented in the physical realm
  - The Body is actually two components (the Bread and Wine of Transubstantiation):
    * The Body - this is what we normally call the God metal (which has, not coincidentally, also been referred to as a God's body in previous books)
    * The Blood - this is the well of power associated with the power
  - This Christ, yo

Given the above breakdown, what I think happened during the shattering of Adonalsium was basically just like what Wax did in Mistborn Era 2 -- they shattered the body of Creation (Adonalsium, it's God metal) into 16 components that they could consume to gain god-like powers.  Wax split Harmonium into Lerasium and Atium -- 2 components that could give even smaller ~g~od-like powers.

Wit is very clear in WaT that the Shards aren't actually Gods, they are gods -- beings of great powers, but not the God God.  Just like Mistborn seem like Gods to the South Scadrians, but are just peeps with cool powers to those in the Basin.

However, that means that the Vessel, the Shard, and the Well of Power of Creation are still out there influencing the Cosmere (shocking, I know, who would've guessed that Dalinar wasn't crazy when he was talking to *the* monotheistic God).

#### Random Dawnshard ish, I dunno
We still don't know much about the Dawnshards, but we know this: the Dawnshard was obviously split from a larger whole and wants to combine back into it's original self.  We saw that in WaT with Rhys and Wit.  Kinda makes since, because otherwise why would it have "shard" in the name?  Obviously there was a single entity that broke into 4 shards, the Dawn, but I'm still not sure how that truly relates to the above.

The fact that the Dawnshards came from (waves hands wildly) *something* called the Dawn, how the absolute eff does that relate to the Dawnsingers?  And also, how does it relate to Creation itself?

My huge, unfounded guess is that the Dawnsingers are called the Dawnsingers because they were created to herald the world into a new Dawn, one where the power of Creation itself was knowlingly -- by Creation itself -- split into 16 in order to truly understand the universe it created.  The Dawnsingers are the Christians in this story, to be the followers of Adonalsium after it's shattering (crucifixion).  Guaranteed they will be "in communion" with Adonalsium in the future, drinking from his well of power -- just like Mishram, Ado's first Acolyte to drink of his blood.

The guess, really, is that Creation had planned the shattering of his physical body long before Hoid and his ragtag band of weirdos even thought of shattering Adonalsium.  Creation created an entire planetary system designed to carefully drive the shattered powers back to him over time, after each of the powers had experienced the universe and matured enough to be back together -- you don't think Dalinar was just saying that the power of Honor had to mature a bit before he gave it up, did you?  This story really seems to parallel the mythology of the Iriali -- which makes it odd that they'd leave Roshar at the end of Era 1 SA and head to Scadrial just in time for the new clash of the Gods, eh??

The Dawn is the tool created by Creation to Dawn in this new era and the Dawnsingers were the the people he created to sing the songs of the new era.  Seriously, why the frick would a being as powerful as Creation give Hoid of all people such a power?  How does Hoid have enough Fortune to always know where to go?  Hoid is another tool, just like the Dawn and the Dawnsingers, of Creation.

My big question here is *what* from the biblical record do the Dawnshards correspond to?  I'm absolutely certain that they correspond to something, but I'm not about to reread the entire New Testament to try to find the relevant "thing" that is split in four parts.

#### The Aethers
I dunno bro.  I'm still trying figure out their place in this.  The one thing I will say, though, is that given the fact that the Iriali where on the complete Aether-messed planet of Lumar (which we know from Tress) during their journey makes me think the Aethers have a hand to play here too.  Maybe they're the Pagan Gods that get beat off by Creation in the end, I dunno.  They do say they were here first.

#### Final Thoughts
Adonalsium's shattering mirrors the crucifixion of Jesus and when Adonalsium finally returns it will usher in the end of days and the dead will rise from the Beyond -- this is why Hoid is so busy interfering, God stole someone he loves and he wants to bring them back from the dead (we hear this directly from Frost in The Traveller).

Mishram is the first Acolyte of Creation.
